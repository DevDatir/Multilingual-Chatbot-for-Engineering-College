## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for backend processing
- **React.js**: Frontend framework for building user interface
- **HTML/CSS**: Frontend structure and styling
- **Flask**: Backend web framework
- **Cohere**: NLP processing for intent extraction and text generation
- **FuzzyWuzzy**: Fuzzy string matching for college name recognition
- **Argos Translate**: Translation capabilities for multilingual support

## Technical Architecture

The chatbot follows this processing pipeline:
1. **Language Detection**: Identifies if the query is in English or Hinglish
2. **Intent Recognition**: Uses Cohere AI to extract intent and entities
3. **Entity Extraction**: Pulls out college names, branch details, ranks, etc.
4. **Data Retrieval**: Fetches information from the dataset
5. **Response Generation**: Constructs appropriate responses based on intent
6. **Translation**: Translates responses if needed for Hinglish queries

## Key Components

### Intent Detection

The system recognizes various intents:
- `cutoff`: Query about college cutoff ranks
- `fees`: Query about college fees
- `highest_package`: Query about highest placement package
- `average_package`: Query about average placement package
- `info`: General information about a college
- `eligibility`: Query to find eligible colleges based on rank
- `best_college`: Query to find the best college from eligible options

### API Endpoints

The Flask application exposes the following endpoint:
- `/chat` (POST): Main endpoint for processing chat queries

## Sample Queries

Users can ask questions like:
- "What is the cutoff for VJTI Computer Engineering?"
- "PICT pune ke computer engineering ka cutoff kya hai?"
- "What are the fees for COEP?"
- "What is the highest package of VJTI?"
- "What colleges can I get with a rank of 5000 in GOPEN category?"
- "Which is the best college I can get with a 3000 rank?"
